    Welcome to my homepage!
</p>

<p class="texto">
    I made this website as my very first project
    of web developing. I used some basic concepts
    of HTML, CSS and Javascript and constructed
    it from zero, without using templates or
    ready-made items (I know, it could be easier
    and prettier, but it would be less important
    to my learning process).
</p>

<p class="texto">
    This page may look ugly and messy according to your
    computer or cell phone. So I'm apologizing now and
    as soon as possible I'll fix this (CSS can be a 
    little tricky sometimes, I don't have the mastery
    in this subject yet).
</p>

<p class="texto">
    Here you will find some information about me,
    the projects I've been developing and how
    to contact me. Enjoy!
</p>
