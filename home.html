    Welcome to my homepage!
</p>

<p class="texto">
    I made this website as my very first project
    of web developing. I used some basic concepts
    of HTML, CSS and Javascript and constructed
    it from zero, without using templates or
    ready-made items (I know, it could be easier
    and prettier, but it would be less important
    to my learning process).

    Here you will find some information about me,
    the projects I've been developing and how
    to contact me. Enjoy!
