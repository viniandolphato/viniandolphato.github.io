<h2 class="titulo">About Me</h2>
<p class="texto">
    Musician since 2007, chemical engineer since 2019, 
    chef since 2020 and developer since... well, 2022!
    I'm starting this new challenge in my life and I
    want you to come with me in this pleasant adventure
    (sounds like another adventure cartoon for kids, huh?).
    Just a little bit more about this brazilian guy:

<ul>
    <li class="li-insert">Music was one of my first interests
                          and I play guitar since I was 12. 
                          Now I play electric guitar, drums, 
                          keyboard and a little of harmonica too 
                          (I'm a huge fan of Led Zeppelin, Tim
                          Maia and Raul Seixas);</li>

    <li class="li-insert">I graduated in Chemical Engineering
                          in 2019 at Unicamp (one of the most 
                          relevant universities in Latin America)
                          and worked in Solvay, one of the 5 biggest
                          chemical companies of the world;</li>

    <li class="li-insert">In 2020, I improved a lot my cooking 
                          skills and discovered it as one of my 
                          favorite hobbies. You can check my super 
                          skills clicking right here in this Instagram account:

    <li class="li-insert">In 2022, I planned a new project of
                          life: I started this journey through
                          the web development learning, looking for
                          a carreer change in a next future</li>
