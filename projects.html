<p class="texto">
    Here you can find the projects I've been developing
    since the very start of my journey of knowledge. The 
    first one was the traditional Rock, Paper and Scissors
    game.

<p class="texto">
    Basically I'm studying Javascript and developing some
    projects to apply the concepts. Furthermore, in this 
    journey, I'm learning some HTML and CSS too. 
    As expected, the projects will become more and more 
    complex in a next future as my experience grows.
